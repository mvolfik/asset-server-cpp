# Asset server

Specifikace: [specifikace.md](specifikace.md)

## Build and run

The project should be easy to build on any Linux (or even any Unix-ish?) system, provided you have these development libraries available:

- Basic build tools: `git`, `cmake`, `make`
- A C++ compiler with support for C++20 or higher - tested with `g++` and `clang`
- Development headers for libraries:
  - `vips` (for image operations)
  - `magic` (for image format detection)
  - `boost` (for HTTP server)
  - `openssl` (for generating hashes)

For example, on Debian-based systems, you can install all of these with

```sh
apt install libvips-dev libmagic-dev libboost-dev libssl-dev cmake make git g++
```

Then simply checkout this repository and run the standard CMake build process:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mvolfik/asset-server-cpp.git
cd asset-server-cpp

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will produce an executable named `asset-server` in your repository.

To run it, you need to provide a configuration file. There is an example one with explanations of all available fields provided in the repository.

From the build folder, use it with `./asset-server --config-file ../asset-server.cfg`.

### Docker build

Alternatively, you can just have Docker/Podman installed - then you can run the server in a container, and you don't have to install any dependencies on your host system.

Dockerfiles are provided in multiple variants, using Debian, Alpine or Fedora as base images, and using gcc or clang as the compiler as a demonstration of platform-independence. You can build the image with

```sh
docker build -t asset-server . -f Dockerfile.debian-gcc # use your preferred variant here
```

To run the image, you need to mount one (!) directory, which will contain two subdirectories - for temporary data, and for the final processed images. Due to the way Docker mounts work, these can't be two separate mounts.

So edit your `asset-server.cfg` to use `./data/tmp` for the temporary directory, and `./data/final` for the final directory, and run the container with

```sh
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ./datus:/app/data -v ./asset-server.cfg:/app/asset-server.cfg asset-server
```

### Development build(s)

There are a few more .cpp files in the repository, used for unit testing some utility functions and for debugging some parts of the project. To have these build, setup the CMake build directory with  
`cmake -DASSET_SERVER_EXTRA_DEBUG=True ..`.

This also adds a build flag `-fsanitize=address` to the build, which requires `libasan-dev` as an additional dependency.

## Upload race-condition safety

Implementation of parallelism, to avoid processing same image twice:

- calculate hash of received image data
- check if image with this hash is already saved; if yes, done
- lock `hashmap<hash, notifier=shared_ptr<atomic_bool>>`
- if entry for given hash exists:
  - get a reference to the notifier
  - unlock hashmap
  - sleep on the notifier (`atomic_bool.wait(true)`)
  - after wakeup, the file is ready, done
- else:
  - create entry with `make_shared(true)`, keep the reference
  - unlock hashmap
  - again, check if image with this hash is already saved, if no:
    - process the image in tmpdir
    - when done, atomically rename the built folder to target location
  - (regardless of whether we actually did the processing, or if we noticed that the result already exists:)
  - lock hashmap again
  - remove the entry
  - unlock hashmap
  - `*notifier = false`
  - `notifier.notify_all()`
  - done

The notifier is simply a bool (behind a shared_ptr, so that it a) doesn't move and b) can be accessed after the hashmap is unlocked) that starts at `true`, and is set to `false` when the image is ready, and all threads waiting on it are then woken up. (The value check/change is necesary, since [spurious wakeups may happen](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/wait).)

The existence check after creating the hashmap entry **is necessary** - in a sense, the first existence check is just an optimization. Here's an example scenario, where the second check saves us from doing the same thing twice:

| request 1                                    | request 2                                    | request 3                         |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |

Repository also contains working two Dockerfiles, using Debian and Alpine as base images.

Windows: untested so far. libvips C++ bindings will likely need to be recompiled from source, I am deferring this for later.
