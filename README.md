## Build and run


## Upload race-condition safety

Implementation of parallelism, to avoid processing same image twice:

- calculate hash of received image data
- check if image with this hash is already saved; if yes, done
- lock `hashmap<hash, notifier=shared_ptr<atomic_bool>>`
- if entry for given hash exists:
  - get a reference to the notifier
  - unlock hashmap
  - sleep on the notifier (`atomic_bool.wait(true)`)
  - after wakeup, the file is ready, done
- else:
  - create entry with `make_shared(true)`, keep the reference
  - unlock hashmap
  - again, check if image with this hash is already saved, if no:
    - process the image in tmpdir
    - when done, atomically rename the built folder to target location
  - (regardless of whether we actually did the processing, or if we noticed that the result already exists:)
  - lock hashmap again
  - remove the entry
  - unlock hashmap
  - `*notifier = false`
  - `notifier.notify_all()`
  - done

The notifier is simply a bool (behind a shared_ptr, so that it a) doesn't move and b) can be accessed after the hashmap is unlocked) that starts at `true`, and is set to `false` when the image is ready, and all threads waiting on it are then woken up. (The value check/change is necesary, since [spurious wakeups may happen](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/wait).)

The existence check after creating the hashmap entry **is necessary** - in a sense, the first existence check is just an optimization. Here's an example scenario, where the second check saves us from doing the same thing twice:

| request 1                                    | request 2                                    | request 3                         |

Repository also contains working two Dockerfiles, using Debian and Alpine as base images.

Windows: untested so far. libvips C++ bindings will likely need to be recompiled from source, I am deferring this for later.
